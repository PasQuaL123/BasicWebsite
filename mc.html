	<div> Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and later developed by Mojang.[g] Minecraft allows players to build with a variety of different cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat.Multiple gameplay modes are available, including a survival mode in which the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players, a spectator mode where players can freely move throughout a world without being affected by gravity or collisions, and a hardcore mode, where the player is given only one life. The PC version of the game allows players to create mods with new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.   </div>
